* Recipe Initialization
* =================================================================================================
* This function initializes all mutation recipes to be held in the global list "mutation_recipe_list",
* which is used for discovering if a given set of mutations can be used to create a new mutation.area
*
* Values in the list have a format of:
* mutation_recipe_list.[compare_string] = list(/datum/genetics/mutation_recipe/recipe_path)
*
* Note that the genes are auto sorted A-Z based on name.
* Combining uses A-Z naming so make sure they are in the correct order!
*
* recipe_path- The type path of a given recipe.
* compare_string-
* 	A concatinated list of mutation keys (created through list2params if there are multiple).
*	If the recipe is an Irradiation type, the compare_string is prepended with an 'I~'
*	If the recipe is an Combination type, the compare_string is prepended with an 'C~'
