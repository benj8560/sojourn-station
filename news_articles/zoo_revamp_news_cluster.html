"And now for this breaking development... it seems that an increase in hostilities from the locals has caused the Nadhezdha advisory scouts to issue a travel advisory for anyone traveling past the sightlines provdied by the colony defenses. This travel warning is to remain in place until such time as Blackshield Command has had time to find the cause of these enemy incursions."

"Ru-Quosh, the receptionist at the check-in desk within the lower wings has been  reporting to us the sudden increase in the need for advanced burn kits. Apparently injuries have been coming in with more advanced burns than are normal, and outsiders have been seen to be interested in obtaining ointments when trading or looting according to SI drone data."

"Alright you overpaid [redacted] nuggets! We have some work to do, by we I mean you. My fingers are itching and that's telling me there's profit to be had. Seems like whatever is out there is leaving tech and building supplies out by those weird ruins they've got out there. And that means shit we can sell. Also, whatever is out there is making Nakharan's comms light up like a [redacted].... He wants something. That means I want it first. You get it, I might... MIGHT... make it worth you peons' time."

Archived broadcast featuring a brief interview with an SI Drone Operator, on the subject of a recent report from within Blackshield
</i>
<br>
Reporter: "So SI-Drones were observing surface operations around the locations known as "Preppers" and "zoo"? <br>
Operator: "That is the case. A strike team made up of Prospectors, Church devotees, and the Guild extensively nuetralized an excusion of Preppers Drones to the Zoo." <br>
Reporter: "Any comments on their operation?" <br>
Operator: "No comment at this time. Assessments are underway by Blackshield analysts. Current intelligence suggests a rudimentary AI attempted to establish a Commercial Zoo Park. This ultimately failed." <br>
Reporter: "Interesting, according to internal Blackshield Communications, Zoo is still receiving drone replacements. What are your thoughts? Is the AI still attempting to achieve its goal?" <br>
Operator: "Speculation on this subject is unavailable, as data analysis is still in progress. No further information will be made publicly available at this time.<br>
