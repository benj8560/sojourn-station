===Marqua Trade Ship (powered by Nadezhda Newscenter®™)===
<br>

"Starlight News-Byte: 'Mar'qua ship wanders to colony'. These people are supposed to be the best minds of the galaxy? Sure took them long enough to find us! Word is they were expected but delayed, touring the system at their leisure and Krios. Appearently they passed us a few times, not noticing. The Soteria Institute, eager for the oppourtunity to further scientific cooperation and goals, reached out to the ship, named 'Kar Thil Kor'. Appearently they took a page out of The Chairman's playbook and lured them in with advertisements, some including their Psionics program.
<br>
<br>
Strangely enough our sources tell us the Mar'qua were indeed interested in trade. We reached out to the High Council Secretary for comment, but received no reply. 
<br>
<br>
Comments from soteria personnel paints a clearer picture, and some are even going as far to complain "The 'Kar Thil Kor' can travel all around the sectors in a blink, and they aren't telling us a damn thing. Tight lipped about everything, except trade and our anomolous artifacts." The sentiments aren't entirely shared however, some scientists commenting on the spectacle at a distance. "All this bowing and scraping for this ship and crew. We're scientists, not sycophants. We do not need to use 'Lonestar strategies' to further our work."
<br>
<br>
Despite the controversy, it is confirmed that some agreement has been hammered out, that will see the ship visiting occasionally to conduct trade and business, the specifics of which remain to be seen. This has been a Starlight News-Byte."
